They unexpectedly meet when Chitoge hops a wall and knees Raku in the face. After she runs off, Raku realizes he has lost his pendant which was given to him by his childhood sweetheart with whom he made a secret promise. After discovering Chitoge is a new transfer student in his class, he forces her to help him look for the pendant. During the search, they begin to dislike each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
Upon returning home, Raku learns that the Shuei-Gumi and Beehive gangs have agreed to settle their feud by pairing their leaders' children. Raku learns that his girlfriend-to-be is none other than Chitoge. For the next three years, they must pretend to be in a relationship to maintain peace between the gangs. This turns out to be quite a challenging task, not only because of their hatred for one another, but also because Raku has a crush on another schoolmate, Kosaki Onodera, whom he secretly wishes was the girl who bears the key to his pendant. Various developments complicate the situation, including Chitoge's over-protective bodyguard, a female hitman, a girl who claims to be Raku's fianc&#xE9;e, and the existence of multiple keys.</Overview>

    <SeriesName>Hitler: The Rise of Evil </SeriesName>
    <banner>/banners/graphical/83054-g2.jpg</banner>
    <Overview>Hitler: The Rise of Evil is a Canadian TV miniseries in two parts, directed by Christian Duguay and produced by Alliance Atlantis. It explores Adolf Hitler's rise and his early consolidation of power during the years after World War I and focuses on how the embittered, politically fragmented and economically buffeted state of German society following the war made that ascent possible. The film also focuses on Ernst Hanfstaengl's influence on Hitler's rise to power. The miniseries, which premiered simultaneously in May 2003 on CBC in Canada and CBS in the United States, received two Emmy awards, for Art Direction and Sound Editing.&#xD;
The film's subplot follows the struggles of Fritz Gerlich, a German journalist who opposes the rising National Socialist German Workers Party. He is portrayed as to fulfill the essence of the quotation disputably attributed to Edmund Burke, which is displayed at the beginning and at the end of the film:&#xD;
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."</Overview>

    <banner/>
    <Overview>The original 'beast from the east', the Nissan Skyline GT-R is an icon for power, speed and advanced Japanese automotive technology. With straight-6 engines capable of being tuned to over 1000bhp, 4WD, intelligent torque-splitting differentials, rear-wheel steering and enough electronics to keep a space station going, the R-32, R-33 and most recent R-34 models are mechanical 'tour de forces' . But what do they go like and what speeds are they really capable of? Our new Duke DVD traces the GT-R's technical development and tuning options, and then puts you in the hot seat for several memorable rides. How about a lap of the old Nurburging with 'ringmeister' Dirk Schoysman at up to 190 mph with drifting at 160mph? Or a ride on a GP track in the ultimate racing Skyline ? the Falken Tyres R34? If that's not scared you, an Autobahn blast at well over 200 mph in a 600 bhp Prospec-NISMO R34 should do the trick! If you thought only ground-hugging 2-seater sportscars with names like Ferrari, Lamborghini or Porsche could be called 'supercars', think again! </Overview>

&#xD;
Ever been bothered by noise? Unwelcome noise can make our lives hell. It changes us from pleasant patient creatures into screaming, desperate crazy types. Noise can make us feud with people we actually quite like, force us to move home, change towns, make us depressed, and literally drive us mad.&#xD;
&#xD;
Across Auckland, unwanted noise happens day and night. And while the Generation Y partiers consider dancing till dawn their birthright, their Gen-X neighbours are well over it mid evening, when they can&#x2019;t get the baby to stop screaming and everyone in the house is desperate for sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
Where can they go for help? To Noise Control. Noise Control Officers are urban peacekeepers, a rare breed of person that residents rely on to help keep the neighbourhood at acceptable levels of noise&#x2026; quiet in the wee small hours, and not too rowdy during the day either. These guys are true local heroes. </Overview>

Tony DiNozzo nearly died of the pneumonic plague in \"SWAK\" while the season finale, \"Twilight\", ended with a shocking and unexpected twist: Caitlin Todd was shot and killed by Ari Haswari.\n\nThis is also the second and final DVD to feature Sasha Alexander who plays Caitlin Todd on the cover. Alexander left the show for good after her character, Todd was killed in the Season 2 finale.\n\nIn addition, this is the first DVD cover that Sean Murray who plays Timothy McGee appears on, having become a permanent member of Gibbs' team at the end of the Season 2 opening episode, \"See No Evil\" which also saw Murray being added to the opening credits as well. Despite having first appeared in Season 1, Murray's appearances were very limited and during the times he appeared, he was credited as a guest star.",

Also, albeit later in the season, Army CID Lieutenant Colonel Hollis Mann is introduced as another love interest for Gibbs.\n\nIn December 2006, Bill Keveney from USA Today announced that the \"CBS investigative drama NCIS topped the Nielsen viewership list for the first time with 17.4 million. CBS was the No. 1 network in viewers and young adults for the week of Dec. 11-17.\"\n\nTV Guide reported on May 5, 2007 that creator and showrunner Donald Bellisario would step down and leave the series due to a disagreement with series star Mark Harmon. Because of Bellisario's \"chaotic management style\", Harmon threatened to leave NCIS. Co-executive producer Chas. Floyd Johnson and headwriter Shane Brennan replaced Bellisario as showrunner.",

Much of the season's story arc then focused on the Mexican Drug War and Colonel Merton Bell, a suspected murderer who hired the lawyer M. Allison Hart to represent him. Hart quickly became a thorn in Gibbs' side by regularly showing up and protecting possible suspects while they were being investigated, claiming that they were her clients.\n\nThe season drew to a close as Gibbs was later kidnapped by someone working for Paloma Reynosa, the daughter of the late Pedro Hernandez, a drug dealer Gibbs himself shot dead twenty years previously as Hernandez had been responsible for killing Gibbs' first wife Shannon and daughter Kelly. While being held prisoner, Paloma informed Gibbs that he would work for her or she would have everyone he ever knew and cared about die if he didn't go through with her demands.",

Season nine introduced several new recurring guest stars, most notably Dr. Samantha Ryan, a love interest for Gibbs.\n\nBy the end of the season, NCIS and the Navy had found themselves under threat from a new and dangerous enemy: insurance CEO-turned terrorist, Harper Dearing, who lost his son in a fire aboard a Navy ship and is out for revenge against the Navy for not solving the problem that led to the fire and then not updating ships with the same problem. He also has a grudge against NCIS, as his son wouldn't have been on the ship if they had not transferred him.\n\nManaging to get a hold of powerful explosives, Dearing started firebombing Navy ships. However, towards the end of the season, Dearing stepped up his game: he had Director Vance abducted. Whilst NCIS found him quickly, it transpired that Dearing was only after Vance for his car, managing to rig up explosives in the car seat so that Vance would unknowingly deliver a car bomb to the Navy Yard. By the time Gibbs realized, it was nearly too late; the bomb detonated, resulting in major damage to the NCIS building, as well as many deaths and injuries and leaving the fates of Gibbs, Tony, McGee, Abby, Ziva and Vance unknown. Upon learning of the destruction, Ducky suffered a heart attack on the beaches of Miami. The finale aired on May 15, 2012.",

Leon Vance and Ziva David soon discover that Mossad Deputy Director Ilan Bodnar was behind the attack, and set out for revenge. They track Bodnar to Berlin, but later learn that he had never left the United States. Going against orders from the Department of Homeland Security, Ziva finds Bodnar on a ship headed for South Africa and kills him. This sparks a massive investigation by the Department of Defense, headed by Richard Parsons. His sneaky and unprofessional methods cause the team to question his true intentions. Everyone soon realizes that he is not interested in Ziva or Vance, but has instead set his sights on Gibbs. Parsons pressures Gibbs to admit that he and his team have broken the law on countless occasions and to come forward and admit everything that he has done. After a long feud, Gibbs is freed of his charges and sent on a top-priority mission, while Ziva, DiNozzo, and McGee resign from the agency. The season ends with a cut to four months later, showing Gibbs aiming a sniper rifle at FBI agent Tobias Fornell. The season finale aired on May 14, 2013.",
